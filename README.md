# US\_Supreme\_Court\_Justices

A repository to analyse the [ideological leanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_leanings_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices) of US\_Supreme\_Court\_Justices.

The [ideological leaning of the median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem) justice is considered a(n almost perfect) measure of where the whole court.

But is it really *that* one-dimensional? See for example: [Network of All Historical U.S. Supreme Court Justices by Voting Coincidence](https://yiqinfu.github.io/posts/supreme-court-kennedy-retirement-ot2017/)
